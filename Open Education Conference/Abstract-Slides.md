## DevoLearn: 
### Engaging learners with Computational Developmental Biology  

While Computational Biology is a fast moving field with a vast number of tools, very few of these tools provide an educational experience along with what is often an opaque user experience. This leaves students and lifelong learners with intermediate computational (or biological) skills quite overwhelmed. Over the past few years, the [DevoWorm group](https://devoworm.weebly.com/) has developed a series of tools culminating in the [DevoLearn Github organization](https://github.com/DevoLearn). We have designed DevoLearn as an open-source hybrid educational/research resource administered from a Github organization. This enables immediate access to the underlying code. Building this resource on Github also allows for new users to contribute resources, as has been done by over a dozen contributors since September 2020. The DevoLearn name is also shared by an accessible pre-trained machine learning model that can enable more accurate data analysis along with the analysis of cells, movement, and pattern formation from microscopy images of an embryo. The software component of the DevoLearn organization also contains a web app that supports _C. elegans_-oriented interactive Computational Developmental Biology. DevoLearnâ€™s educational component provides resources for learning about model organisms, resources for theory-building and numeric simulation, in addition to a collection of data science demos. As an open-source resource, the long-term plan is to not only integrate DevoLearn into the teaching mission of the DevoWorm group, but to provide an open-source educational resource for assisting incipient interdisciplinary collaborations.

## Upgrading DevoLearn 
Devolearn was created during Google Summer of Code 2020, and is now a standalone program (PyPi repository: https://pypi.org/project/devolearn/). DevoLearn contains pre-trained Deep Learning models for the segmentation/analysis of microscopy images. It is specialized for the analysis of 2-D slices of _C. elegans embryogenesis_, although it can be useful in the analysis of embryogenesis in other species. This project will focus on creating benchmarks for performance and then testing the improved models on a broad range of data-sets. Your goals will be to improve overall performance in terms of accuracy and generalizability, enhance functionality (via a graphical user interface), and perhaps add additional pre-trained models to the DevoLearn library. Proficiency in Python(deep-learning and computer-vison) is required.

### More details:
#### There would be 4 key elements in this project:
* Improving the current models
* Training and adding more useful models 
* Improving usability
* (optional) Interactive online demos. 

#### Improving the current models
We used the simple train-test split approach while training the deep learning models for devolearn, in order to get better performance we should use techniques like:

* _k_-fold cross validation 
* Ensemble models 
* Hyperparameter optimization 
* Label smoothing 
* Mixed precision inference
* Using more training data for re-training the pre-existing models for better accuracy.

#### Adding more models

Devolearn should also contain pre-trained deep-learning models from other species which are of high importance in developmental biology. We can split up the different species as:

__Example:__   
~~~
from devolearn.c_elegans import segmenter          ## species 1   
from devolearn.zebra_fish import age_estimator     ## species 2
~~~

#### Improving usability  
As the library grows, we should have a better place to host proper documentation on a static website which could be named like devoworm.github.io/devolearn/docs. 

Most importantly, we have to train devolearnâ€™s deep-learning models on commonly available data, the more common the use case, the more helpful it is to the community. 

#### Online demos

Colab notebooks, however simple they may seem, are still a bit intimidating to people from non CS backgrounds, so there should be a focus on making interactive demos which showcase both our research and tutorials. For example, we can make semi-interactive web pages to make it more readable and intuitive. An example can be found on [this paper](https://distill.pub/2017/feature-visualization/#enemy-of-feature-vis). 

#### More Information on Pre-requisites
Proficiency in python with a good hold of tools like numpy, pandas and PyTorch will be required.

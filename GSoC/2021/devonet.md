## DevoNet: Generalized Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for Biological Data 

A Convolutional Neural Network (ConvNet/CNN) is a Deep Learning algorithm which can take in an input image, assign importance (learnable weights and biases) to various aspects/objects in the image and be able to differentiate one from the other.[1] The pre-processing required in a ConvNet is much lower as compared to other classification algorithms. While in primitive methods filters are hand-engineered, with enough training, ConvNets have the ability to learn these filters/characteristics [2].

Transfer learning is a common practice in Deep learning because it enables us to build reliable models in a timesaving way. With transfer learning, rather than starting the learning process from scratch, we start from exemplars that have been learned when solving a different problem. In this way we can leverage previous learnings and avoid starting from scratch (It is like standing on the shoulder of giants.) [3]

The intuition behind transfer learning for image classification is that if a model is trained on a large and general enough dataset, this model will effectively serve as a generic model of the visual world. You can then take advantage of these learned feature maps without having to start from scratch by training a large model on a large dataset.

We can use these pre-trained models to extract a general description of classes and features without requiring a prohibitive amount of training data.
We estimate that the amount of required training data may be reduced by an order of magnitude. To get this advantage, pre-trained models must be suitable to the type of input data. There are a number of models specialized for language processing and general use, but options are fewer within the unique feature space of developmental biology. Devonet will be a CNN designed specifically for Biological data, and  will increase the scope of transfer learning and will significantly advance the prevailing Deep learning results.

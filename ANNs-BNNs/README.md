## Connectionism, Complexity, and Living Systems: a comparison of Artificial and Biological Neural Networks
Krishna Katyal, Jesse Parent, and Bradly Alicea

While Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) have yielded impressive results in the realm of simulated intelligent behavior, it is important to remember that they are but sparse approximations of Biological Neural Networks (BNNs). We go beyond  comparison of ANNs and BNNs to introduce principles from BNNs that might guide the further development of ANNs as embodied neural models. These principles include representational complexity, complex network structure/energetics, and robust function. We then consider these principles in ways that might be implemented in the future development of ANNs. In conclusion, we consider the usefulness of this comparison, particularly in terms of building more robust and dynamic ANNs. This may even include constructing a morphology and sensory apparatus around the network, which potentially unlocks the power of lifelike BNNs.
